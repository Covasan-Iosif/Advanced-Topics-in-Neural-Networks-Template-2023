## Assigment 5

I have implemented the logging system using Tensorboard and weights & biases to hyper-tune my parameters.
I evaluated the performance  of the following optimizers: SGD, Adam, RMSProp and AdaGrad.

I ran 3 different configurations for every optimizer  listed above and the results are in the weight and biases and Tensorboard logs. My best result came from the run in which I used the SGD optimizer with 0.7 momentum, 0.01 lr and a batch size of 128. 

The validation accuracy of that result was 0.4758.
 
I uploaded a folder with the Tensorboard logs.
